# GitHub without command line

This is a Carpentries-style lesson for how to use GitHub version control and collaboration, without any command line. This is meant to be an alternative to any of the Carpentries "Git with Command Line" lessons.

This lesson began as a fork of the [Code Refinery course of the same name](https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/), but has since been overhauled for teaching as part of the Carpentries program (mostly at the Smithsonian Institution) and is not a Carpentries Incubator lesson.
